                                            <p>Answer:</p>
                                            <p>BFL has always had strong liquidity. BFL has learnt this from the previous crisis namely, the IL&FS crisis. TLTRO was not used by BFL. The effect of the moratorium was about 20-25%. Diversified portfolios have helped BFL to keep its liquidity high. Thus, the situation after the announcement of RBI’s moratoriums measures for customers was much under control for BFL as compared to other NBFCs.</p>
                                            <p>(What is TLTRO?: RBI cannot directly give money to NBFCs firms, so RBI lends it to the banks and in turn forces banks to buy the bonds of these firms. NBFCs or Corporates can issue new bonds, and those bonds will be bought by banks using the TLTRO money. NBFCs can then use the money to pay back existing bond obligations.To ease liquidity pressure on NBFCs, the RBI has taken multiple actions including a Targeted Long-Term Repo Operation (TLTRO) for the sector of Rs. 50,000 crore and a special financing window through SIDBI, NABARD and National Housing Bank (NHB) of another Rs. 50,000 crore to enable financing NBFCs.)
</p>					<p>(What is liquidity?: Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset, or security, can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price.)</p>

The pandemic came with opportunities. Loans on digital products like laptops, phones increased.
</p>						<p>BFL ended the year with a net NPA of 0.65% on a consolidated basis. The standalone net NPA stood at 0.79%. On a consolidated basis, the Company’s provision coverage on non-NPA assets, excluding the contingency provision, stood at 97 bps; and 159 bps including the contingency provision. BFL took several steps to manage its risk costs including lowering of AUM growth over four quarters of FY2020. It has also re-pivoted its mix towards lower risk assets like mortgages.

                                        <p> Since Bajaj is an NBFC, channels for borrowing are limited (for example we cannot borrow from RBI). After the liquidity crisis we realised that we cannot rely just on market borrowing. Term loans and public deposits have their own shortcomings. In case of any crisis we won't get any money back. So in order to grow our balance sheet we started borrowing from ECBs. Borrowing from ECBs makes up for the shortcomings of the other types of liabilities. Besides that, the interest rate of ECBs is lower compared to others which helps us in making more profit.

</p>						<p>In the case of FIIs, it is basically required when we borrow money from the market may be foreign markets but as they are increasing so it's good. But we haven’t focused significantly during this period to attract more FIIs.

As we have declined with AUM expectations, which more due to current sensibility in the business market due to COVID.

                                        Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a method of budgeting in which all expenses must be justified for each new period. The process of zero-based budgeting starts from a "zero base," and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. Budgets are then built around what is needed for the upcoming period, regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the previous one. Rather than cutting down people we are using ZBB to manage our expenses.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Because of its detail-oriented nature, zero-based budgeting may be a rolling process done over several years, with a few functional areas reviewed at a time by managers or group leaders. Zero-based budgeting can help lower costs by avoiding blanket increases or decreases to a prior period's budget. It is, however, a time-consuming process that takes much longer than traditional, cost-based budgeting.

                                        <p>Cross-selling of products was increased. Loans on digital products were given more focus. Rural areas had less riskier assets than the urban areas, thus, BFL concentrated on this to increase sales. Online payments were encouraged and the customers too preferred online payments due to its contactless nature.  </p>

What would be the effect of US elections on the Indian Capital Market and the business of BFL?  If Trump comes to power again, it is predicted that the Indian manufacturing industry should grow. Will BFL focus on this and will there be any significant changes in the policies?</a>

                                        <p>While the US accounts for only 5 percent of the world population, it generates 20 percent of the world income, underlining the economic implications of this election. We expect the Indian and global stock markets to trade sideways till this election overhang gets over. Once the election event is gone, global investors will start looking at fundamentals of Asian companies once again. So, markets may move up after elections no matter what the outcome is. </p>	
                                        <p>US election will not impact on BFL business, as BFL is Indian private sector but there are some other reasons which may causes effects on BFL like Covid19.</p>

Although along with risk premium there are many factors that affect the interest rate calculation but risk premium rates usually vary by business, customer segment and geography. Is this the only reason why BFL’s interest rate is not constant for all customer segments?</a>

                                        <p>A risk premium is the investment return an asset is expected to yield in excess of the risk-free rate of return. An asset's risk premium is a form of compensation for investors. It represents payment to investors for tolerating the extra risk in a given investment over that of a risk-free asset. </p>	
                                        <p>BFL is a data driven company. We categorise customers based on the risk associated with them. Higher the risk associated with a customer, higher is the interest rates. Lower the risk, lower is the interest rate.</p>

                                        <p>BFL is still in its growth phase. We're yet to establish our presence in many regions. Naturally, more the distance from Bajaj's main office, the harder it is to establish our presence there. Besides these obvious reasons, Bajaj is yet to establish its presence in the North due to political reasons.
